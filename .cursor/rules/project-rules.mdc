# Use up to date features and documentation
When adding a new feature to the app, first check how similar features were implemented and then use a similar pattern.
If you don't find a similar pattern, then use Context7 to retrieve up to date technical information related to implementing the feature.

For example, use context7 to retrieve Nextjs documenation on a feature before adding it to the app.

For example, when creating a new UI component, first use context7 to check if a shadcn component exists that can be used, instead of creating one from scratch. Run the command to install the shadcn compoments.
