Project Context Rule
- On starting a new conversation, load and parse the project README.md file to reconstruct context.
- After implementing changes, update README.md to record new components, packages, or project rules.
- On starting a new conversation, load the package.json file to understand the libraries used in the project.

# Use up-to-date documentation and existing patterns
When adding a new feature:
- First, check if similar features or components already exist in the project and follow those patterns.
- If no clear pattern exists, use Context7 to retrieve the latest technical documentation (e.g., Next.js, shadcn, Langchain, Langgraph, NextAuth, Drizzle ORM) before implementing.
- Prefer reusing or installing existing components over building from scratch.
- If a shadcn component is suitable, run the install command to add it instead of building from scratch.
