# Project Context Rule

- On starting a new conversation, load and parse the project scratchpad (/project/SCRATCHPAD.md) file to reconstruct context.
- After implementing changes, update scratchpad to record new components, packages, or project rules.
- On starting a new conversation, load the package.json file to understand the libraries used in the project.

# Project scratchpad rules

- The scratchpad will be added to LLM calls and coding agents for context.
- The scratchpad should be kept lean and include a concise view of the project, like it's core features, technology and rules.
- After implementing changes to the project, take the existing SCRATCHPAD content, add the new rules, features, etc. and rewrite the SCRATCHPAD to be lean and concise.

# Use up-to-date documentation and existing patterns

When adding a new feature:

- First, check if similar features or components already exist in the project and follow those patterns.
- If no clear pattern exists, use Context7 to retrieve the latest technical documentation (e.g., Next.js, shadcn, Langchain, Langgraph, NextAuth, Drizzle ORM) before implementing.
- Prefer reusing or installing existing components over building from scratch.
- If a shadcn component is suitable, run the install command to add it instead of building from scratch.
