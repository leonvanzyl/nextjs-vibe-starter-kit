## Meta-Prompt for Context Handoffs

This conversation is reaching the context limit. Please create a comprehensive handoff summary for the next AI agent formatted as a prompt. Structure it as 'Context for [Project Name]' and include:
1. Project overview and current location
2. Current status with clear ✅/❌ indicators
3. Key technical details and architecture
4. What's working vs what needs attention
5. Important lessons learned or gotchas
6. File structure and key files
7. Next logical steps or areas to explore
Format it as if you're briefing a new agent who needs to immediately understand the project state and be ready to continue helping. Include enough context that they won't need to ask basic questions about what we've built or where we are in the process.
